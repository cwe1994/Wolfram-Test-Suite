# Wolfram-Test-Suite

This is a test suite to verify the different steps and functionalities of the Wolfram Cloud site:

1. Go to Wolfram Cloud (www.wolframcloud.com).

2. Click Wolfram Development Platform. Please create a new Wolfram ID, and you can subscribe to a Free plan.

After signing in successfully, you will be taken to the Homescreen.

From the Homescreen, users can create new notebooks, upload files, etc.

3. On the right-hand side of the application, you will see a red "New" button.

By clicking the down-arrow button, you can create different types of files (.nb, .html, .css, etc).

4. Create a .nb notebook.

5. In the new notebook, in the file header, click the file name field, "(unnamed)" -- you will see that the extension, ".nb" is automatically present.
